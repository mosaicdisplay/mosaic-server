on carbohydrates effect on people -- exercising
• Bread is candy, candy is poison. When blood sugar spikes, your body's response with insulin dramatically affect your blood-sugar level and bodyfat percentage, making you possibly more hungry, and certainly giving you more bodyfat.
• If you're trying to loose weight, exercise in the morning, aerobically, before you've had anything to eat or nutritional to drink. This ensures the short term reserves in your liver will be emptied and that exercise will literally use bodyfat.
• Eat food that dissolve slowly. They will release sugars into your blood stream in a more steady fashion. Mushy, carb-y foods tend to dissolve quickly. Use bread, chips, pretzels, and fruit as tasty candy treats.. They really shouldn't be the major portion of your meal. Protein, fiber, and fats should be.
• Fat is not evil. Sugar is sorta evil. Don't listen to what they say, fat from food doesn't stick directly to your bones after ingestion, it's dissolved by bile and other processes. Fat is not the enemy: it actually makes you feel full, and can slow digestion of the dairy products it's mixed with. Because of rapid digestion of carbohydrates, it's possible to eat a virtually unlimited number of potato chips, for example-- not so with fats. If your worried about health implications, I encourage you to get blood work done before and two months after you've switched to eating more slow foods.
• If it tastes the least bit sweet, there's a clue that the food will dissolve quickly, or that it will affect your blood sugar rapidly. Even artificial sugars have the potential to cause an insulin response (let me reference this), which can cause you to gain fat even if you're not calorically overdosing.  
• Transitioning away from carbohydrates is a painful process that includes much tiredness, but it was worth it to me:
• Anecdotally, I used to feel very uncomfortable if I didn't exercise every other day when I was eating bread and rice as major components of meals. It was hard to focus. I feel more stable when eating more stable, slower food. It makes sense. 
• Even more anecdotally, your millage will vary, when I started eating more slow-to-digest foods, my skin conditions were markably lessened. I'd like to do a real study on this, to see if its true for other people, so perhaps you can be in touch if you're a carb-eater and have skin troubles.

on doing things well
• I've recently discovered personal virtue to doing a small number of things well over doing many things poorly. 
• It's actually made me substantially more happy. 
• Possibly people with higher IQs can do more things well, but I'm satisfied.
• You can only learn by failing yourself. I learned how to do only a small number of things well by oversubscribing myself to way too many things, failing at most of them, then cutting back to feeling like I have extra time, and doing fairly well in those areas and feeling way more happy. AND SO CAN YOU.

on having opinions
• Opinions are for more than politicians, I wish more people weren't afraid of openly sharing their opinions; maybe if there were fewer people who would punish them for their opinions, more people would share. 
• Everyone's capable of taking an active role in their world and providing input on how they think it should be-- to stand aside without input is foolish. EG, the supreme court vote on gay marriage is a big deal, even if they avoid a decision. Strangely, not much of this webpage features politics particularly...
• Simulataneously, maybe I'll take down this website if coerced by family or some other entity or group.. I'd keep you posted. ;)

happiness vs lack of suffering
• What real relevance is happiness? I think it's something to optimize for on the individual level, but not something optimizable for externally. 
• People don't know what makes them happy, they often feel money and a new car will, but it's everyone's individual lifelong struggle to figure out.
• As a politician, is it possible to create policy decisions based on how happy one's constituents will be in their lives. I would say it isn't. 
• A much more quantifiable process is the optimization for reductions in suffering. Suffering, I propose, is universal:
• The pain of creatures on physical and emotional levels display quantifiable queues, moreover its standards are shared among different communities.
• In fact, almost no American social policy is developed to make 'good situations even better,' but instead to remove some aspect of suffering from individuals and families. 

animal welfare and food choices
• Consider a hypothetical situation wherein you're the creature being raised for food. 
• My question for myself when deciding is, "was animals life a net positive thing?" There literally is a point where I say, "if I given the choice to live a normal life to age 40, whereby I'd be slaughtered for food, I'd accept it over my never living to begin with." 
• It's strange how easy one's own decisions to eat specifically morally animals readily shifts when 1) you're hungry, 2) you're at a restaurant or buffet where it's right there and already dead
• What is the psychological basis for individuals realizing problems, yet choosing to ignore them? See my ramblings on hotspots below. 

suffering as permanent human state
• Do some people always have to suffer here on earth?
• If we were to alleviate the pains that people had vis-a-vis lack of material possessions, they would still have suffering from emotional trauma. 
• I believe they'd repopulate to the sustainment level, then be unhappy because of lack of material possessions again.
• So how much suffering or conversely happiness is there on the planet? Is the value relatively constant?
• People don't really just want to think about their immediate field of view, volunteerism is a fantastically popular thing in the USA, I just believe that no-one is capable of confronting the whole world without going insane from grief. 

on improving the world vs letting it slide by and being under the waves
• This world is fucking tough to live in if you think about how tough it is--
• the opposite of thinking about it, though, is to totally ignore the fact there are problems, and to exist in a state of blissful ignorance.
• What's the advantage in living in the world knowing that the world is awful, full of unhappiness and suffering?
• It's something along the same lines of the explanation my friend gives for why people who 'want to be happy don't just do heroin:' "it's not fulfilling."
• Are people whose long-term life goals focus on 'being happy' often discontent with their current way of living?
• People who take antidepressants often refer to their lack of affect-- but being depressed is an equally bad state, if it's going to destroy their life-- which is worse? Can we say if living without strong feelings, yet surviving is a better or worse thing than living with full emotions and being unhappy for large portions of time?

humanity as a commodity
• 'hiHowareyou' spouts the attendant at the local chipotle
• your flight attendants have permanent smiles on
• people use courtesy as an offensive weapon when having a discussion when visiting a public service center, like the DMV.. Making you almost feel bad to hear 'thank you sir'
• Websites like facebook and twitter, have pitched a commoditized, rapid-fire version of humanity that barely fulfills our social interaction quota, but does enough of a good job to keep us moving.
• Why is it that people demand and enjoy commoditized friendship?
• Are they afraid of rejection? Do they feel these pretend interactions are substantial to temporally content them?
• Most of all, how did these social interactions develop? Where did they progress from having a few shopkeepers that you met with on daily basis for bare essentials and knew their names and their families, to your walking into a fast food chain and being asked about 'hihowareyou?' 
• Do I want my fast food to come with a greeting? Yes, yes I do. Do I feel better or permanently more happy because someone in the store greeted me? Not really, but I'm more likely to return later. 

hotspots in cultural sensitivity -- hobojacket et all-- and when people care
• Hobojacket sparked something that was lingering beneath the surface in society. Its creator, Jin, got such a disproportionate backlash-to-input ratio that proves that there is incredible tension lying in this area. 
• All he did was create a website for people to give rival college's jackets to the homeless.
• What characterizes a cultural hotspot? With the homeless, many individuals go through a dilemma on whether they should even look at said homeless person, not mention give to them. They feel badly when they see them, but they choose not to act on their feeling. 
• I believe this is what characterizes a cultural hotspot, the individuals recognition of a social/moral problem, but their refusal to do anything about it.
• Are there other areas that are hotspots?
• One that isn't a hotpot is the modern emphasis on the protection of 'disadvantaged youths,' whom countless programs now seek out to put through their special programs. Why is it that disadvantaged youths are more assisted than the same disadvantaged people a few year their elder?
• Possibly it's that their numbers are not unlimited, the term of their assistance is length finite, and many of their problems are seen as 'not their fault.'

Hotspot: Animal welfare is another hotspot in united states culture. 
• Laboratories need to transport mice colonies in black bags, and store them in the basement of their facilities because of social perception of the evils of torturing animals.
• Simultaneously, people eat chicken and beef which has been subject to the most horrid of overcrowding, and the least descent of nutrition (with even forced cannibalism ).
• Many people have seen movies on the conditions of the animals treated in these facilities, yet they choose not to change their behaviors. Some people become vegetarian for short periods after seeing said documentaries, inferring there is some psychological effect to the problem itself. For the most part, people recognize the problem, yet choose to do nothing and even participate in the problem.
• It's my belief therefore, that animal welfare is a hotspot that is waiting to be discovered by those unfortunate few who get into the public's view.

Hotspot: Personal welfare and fitness, and self image is another field.
• Any time there is a disproportional response to an input, there is cause for investigation.
• People are left in a constant state of confusion around how to maintain their health and an image that's acceptable and desirable based on popular norms.
• There must (already) be research done on whether most people feel comfortable with their image: I feel they don't. 
• The confusion causes people to try all sorts of odd mechanisms to try to gain a positive image: weird diets, strange exercise programs, etc. An extremely large number of people participate in such things.
• People have the experience of trying many things, but always failing to achieve their goal of improved self. I view this sort of dazzled state of being as cause for major backlash when channeled specifically. It should be my assumption, even before much research, that the debunking of said fads and trends results in disproportional vehement retaliation on the side of participants. 
• I'm not convinced, however, that it does. People who've been con'd out of their money don't like speaking about it. Maybe this is the same. More than anything people blame themselves.
• This is a truly gigantic hotspot, I feel, as people not only feel badly, but they also try to solve the problem and consistently fail. As long as they keep trying something new, and don't loose hope, I don't think this will surface, however... Perhaps this is some sort of indicator of the 'human spirit' that needs to be explored more.

Hotspot: College as a mechanism for social mobility
• People pay 200k+ for a liberal arts education that will start them making roughly 3X poverty level (I suppose <= minimum subsistence resources), and will possibly take 40 years to pay off. Even still, they're not guaranteed a job AT ALL. 
• So they have every right to be pissed. People go to school, because they're supposed to, and the dream of a good life is there for them vis-a-vis education only to not receive its benefits after graduation.
• What's going on here? Who're the irresponsible ones? I still think people are figuring out how they feel about the american dream, and they certainly don't know who to blame.
• People start feeling disillusioned, but they don't act on it, because they blame themselves. At some future point when there's a critical mass of unemployed someone blames the government, and all the emotions come to the surface.

%Selective moral compass vision -- using your compass in a tunnel
• It's possible to ignore everything in the world except what affects oneself. How is that possible?
• Many people actively acknowledge that certain aspects of the world are terrible, but choose to exclude these aspects from their emotional processing.

What's the cause of depression, is it guilt, mostly?
A novel/research treatise on vulnerability, Daring Greatly, suggests that guilt is different than shame, insofar as shame is a negative destructive emotion, whereas guilt can be constructive.. Ie, "Damn, that was a stupid and terrible thing to do (guilt)," vs "I'm a stupid, terrible person (shame)." 
Ok, with a new definition, perhaps shame is the cause of most depression?

Does someone always need to take the moral low-ground such that others can take the moral high-ground?
Settlers massacred Native Americans and sent them packing. Today we stop construction of tunnels if we find relics of our cultural heritage. 
Now abstract it to national intelligence and security interests. Can you still decry international crimes of war if your nation is water boarding international suspects? Only if you also decry your own national policies and actively try to prevent them, methinks. 
But what if we view the intelligence extracted through coercive techniques as necessary-- would it be better never to know it was happening?

On what characterizes friendship 
• My behavior is changed because of my interactions with that person. Applied: No leechy, or ingratiating one-way relationships are friendships. Strip yourselves.
• I am wanting to support the other person, and hear what's going on in their lives. Applied: Life is too short for having half-feelings with people. Don't spend time with people unless you're serious about expanding your relationship.
• If what you're seeking is influence, perhaps you should get good at organizing parties. Parties are also great because they introduce people you care about to interesting people who perhaps they'll care about. That's good.

A nice analogy of trust in a relationship:
It's a jar of marbles. Throw in a couple for remembering birthdays, take a few out for time, a few out for not returning a call. 
Marble level = trust level. Smash the jar for total betrayal of trust, like social sabotage for personal gain. 
This analogy is by Brené Brown. 

The limits of friendship
• You've for a long time hung out with this other person who you've been able to discuss your life with. Now this person is going through a super-hard time, so much so that it's starting to bring you down too-- they just require a seemingly unlimited amount of attention and caring in order to get through it.
• Even with a less dramatic case, how much are you willing to help a friend in need? Are you willing to share your house with them? Would you be willing to help them with some expenses when they needed it?
• What are the limits of your friendship? 
• The only reason I can justify spending large amounts of time or resources with certain people in order to help them deal with their lives is if they'll be making a positive contribution to the world once recovered. More generally, that their interests, once mentally or economically improved, will align with mine. 
• I want to be friends with people who want to have a positive impact on the world-- it's not enough just to deal with some shared sort of experience. Simply having a shared experience, I'm convinced, will not stand up to difficulty.
• Granted I have few friends, but I simply cannot be there for people who'd like to demand >1 hr of time a day for the rest of my life when I see no benefit from it, and I see no outcome that benefits anyone except that person. It's irrational, and it's not what friendship is.
• All friendship, therefore, is subject to reservation of continued mutual benefit vis-a-vis shared interests, even in the most broad sense of both trying to improve the world in comparable ways.

On singularity:
http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-20/the-ray-kurzweil-show-now-at-the-googleplex#r=tec-ls says singularity is "the moment when superintelligent machines light up with something approximating life and either destroy humanity or carry it to unimaginable heights," which I feel is an opinion derived by those totally obsessed with the terminator trilogy. 
I think the opinion here on singularity is a bit harsh-- I think it's when our machines disappear and are indistinguishable from humans while enabling them. Eg, 'Pay With Square,' that allows you to pay for things without taking your phone out of your pocket.

On cleanliness in restrooms:
Wash your hands FIRST. Don't touch anything with your bare hands. Use paper to open doors, to operate faucets, etc.

On shame:
Do you feel shameful for something in relation to another person? What's the reciprocal feeling that person might be feeling-- is it also shame, is it disappointment? 
As long as your actions have reflected your positive intentions, you shouldn't feel shame. Moreover, what you view as embarrassment or shame in yourself is often courage in the eyes of another.

On self-worth:
It's easy to feel lack of self worth. If your overall goal is to make the world a better place, and if you generally make efforts towards that, then you should feel self-worthy for contributing towards humanity. Helping humanity live longer is really the only universal thing to feel good about, and is in fact, the only meaningful life purpose that I've found thus far.. Optimizing for happiness just doesn't cut it for me. 
Even if the whole world was confused about what you're doing, hold to your stance, your being correct will be worth it if we're all wrong and it saves us.
Let me echo millennia of psychotherapists: happiness comes from within you; self worth comes from your self.

%On international affairs budgets:
Strong human relationships are the only international assurance for peace. Programs that enable our best, brightest, and most hopeful to travel the world and make connections that bring us all closer are worth every penny. 

%On textbooks in liberal arts:
It seems that most modern textbooks are written from a podium far removed from the practical lives of their readers. One communications textbook gives examples of a European town during WW2 that switched languages with the tide of the war, but what it ought to be doing was teaching individuals how to be self-directed, self-evaluating lifetime learners, and providing them with an overall methodology.

There is no logic in intimacy
Your logical, utilitarian approach to intimacy won't work. Try and fail. Feelings will be hurt.
You hardly control your own emotions, and you're nowhere near in-control of the rest of your 100 million year mammalian ancestry that has optimized for species survival, not your logic. 

Expectations matter. Harvard and MIT at a crosswalk. 
Harvard students will walk straight out into the road expecting traffic to stop, and it does, often graciously. 
MIT students venturing nearby off campus will timidly enter a street, and cars won't wait. They wait for the cars.
Many Harvard students expect cars to stop, and they do. That's the only substantially difference I see. Really. If you something else, please point it out, and I'll correct it here. This leads to relationship expectations:

If you love someone, set them free
I want to feel like someone spends their time with me not because they're compelled, but because they want to be spending time with me. 
In romantic relationships, thousands of years of history, perhaps since antiquity, predicate expected courtship behavior. "He asked me out, and I said yes, so now I have to answer his text messages and go out with him twice a week." This is what I worry about in romantic relationships. 
What to do? I say, based on the last few opinions, perhaps you 1) don't label it a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship but have a mutual understanding of your romantic relationship. Though you have a different name, you still should 2) avoid extra-relationship deep-intimacy, i.e. the kind that turns on your chemical addiction, as to avoid inevitable hurt feelings. 
SIMULTANEOUSLY, 3) be way more liberal about your definition of friendship. Cuddling under the stars, kissing (clean, dry!), or holding hands are all fairly romantic in modern society, but are things that I could imagine still wanting to do when I'm 80 years old, wayy after my expiration date, if you please. I want to have and encourage people to have this sort of relationship, as I feel it's a major part of genuine human connection.
Result: romantic relationship where you're certain you're prioritizing the person you want to be spending time with a person you want to, because neither of you is cut off from meaningful friendships in the larger world. 

%Technocrats: to feel or to optimize
Many people I know in universities or startups talk about their lives in terms of optimizing for happiness. Their feelings only exist in a shroud of happiness optimization, while feelings for the sake of feelings exist in a shroud of embarrassment or shame. 
That's sad, but it's also hard to be pedantic while talking about feelings. How can this be fixed?
